## YT Analysis

This project sets out to create a framework to retrieve a youtube channels overall data using google's YouTube API as well as a custom webscraper I built to scrape thumbnails (pngs) of each video. This project also leverages AWS's Paramstore as a secrets manager to securely utilize API keys and credentials without passing them explitly in the script.
